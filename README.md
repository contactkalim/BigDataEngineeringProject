# Big Data Engineering Project
End to End Big data engineering project with streamed and batch data analysis using Flume, Kafka, Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, Scala, Hive and HBase with sample datasets.
1. Load batch dimension tables data text files to MySql
2. Load history tables data to MySql using Sqoop
3. Stream JSON file to Kafka using Flume
4. Spark Streaming to produce real time KPI's using streamed and batch data lookup.
5. Spark Streaming to HBase to save streamed data
6. Join 2 streams in Spark Streaming and push to Kafka Topic.
